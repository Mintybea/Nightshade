# Nightshade
Credit to Foxtrek64 for providing the original file, which I tweaked and expanded to my liking. You can find them here https://github.com/Foxtrek64
This is an updated dark mode for Ferzu which I've dubbed Nightshade
          To install
          1) Make sure you have the Stylus extension for Chrome, or any firefox equivalent.
          2) Install and extract the file
          3) Go to the management page of Stylus and select IMPORT
          4) Find the .json file located within the Nightshade folder and import it
          5) Make sure the theme is enabled
          6) You're good to go!
          
          I CANNOT GAURANTEE THAT STYLUS/NIGHTSHADE WILL WORK ON MOBILE, THIS THEME WAS INTENDED FOR PC ONLY
